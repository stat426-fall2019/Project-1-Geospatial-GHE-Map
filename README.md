    The purpose of this repository is to teach users how to create geospatial visualizations, using plotly. 

    The 'Geo spatial plotting tutorial.pynb' notebook contains a tutorial on how to import and clean data, then use that data to make a geospatial visualization. 

    The 'cdp.png' file is a screenshot of the webpage where I got the data for this tutorial. 

    '2016_-_Citywide_GHG_Emissions.csv' is a dataset that contains Total Greenhouse Emissions (GHE) for various cities across the world. Here is a list of the features in this dataset and what they contain:
    - 'Account Number': the ID for the city
    - 'City Name': The full name of the ciyy
    - 'Country': Country
    - 'City Short Name': The abbreviated name for the city
    - 'C40': a groub of 94 cities that represents one twelfth of the world's population. This column indicates whether the city is categorized as one of these cities
    - 'Reporting Year': The year that the GHE emissions are reported in
    - 'Measurement Year': The year that the GHE emissions were taken
    - 'Boundary': The type of city (i.e., metropolitan, boundary of local government, etc.)
    - 'Primary Methodology': the regulation, guideline, or protocol that the city is subject to.
    -'Methodology Details': explanation of the primary methodology
    -'Gases Included': list of the Greenhouse gasses that were included in their measurement
    -'Total City-wide Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)': C02e reported for the city, measured in metric tonnes
    -'Total Scope 1 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)': the total scope 1 co2e emssions for a city, in metric tonnes
    -'Total Scope 2 Emissions (metric tonnes CO2e)': the total scope 2 co2e emissions for  a city, in metric tonnes
    -'Increase/Decrease from last year': whether the city's c02e emissions increased or decerased
    -'Reason for increase/decrease in emissions': stated reason for why the city increased/ decreased their emisssions
    -'Current Population Year': year that population measurement comes from 
    -'Current Population': city's population
    -'City GDP': city's GDP
    -'GDP Currency': what currency 'city gdp' is measured in 
    -'Year of GDP': year in which the gdp measuremnent was taken
    -'GDP Source': what the source of measurement is for gdp
    -'Average annual temperature (in Celsius)': average temperature for the city (in celcius)
    -'Land area (in square km)': area of city, in km^2
    -'Average altitude (m)': city's altitude
    -'City Location': city's longitude and latitude
    -'Country Location': country's longitude and latitude
